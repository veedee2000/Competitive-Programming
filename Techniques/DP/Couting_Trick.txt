Given a sum of elements (n) and a number of elements (k), find the number of distinct arrays under these conditions:

In each array, the there are k elements whose sum is equal to n.

In each array, each element should be greater than or equal to the element on its left.

All elements have to be positive integers

Example:

n = 8 k = 4

Answer: 5

Explanation: [1,1,1,5], [1,1,2,4], [1,1,3,3], [1,2,2,3], [2,2,2,2]

Each array has 4 (k) elements a sum of 8 (n) with each element on the left <= element on the right. There are 5 possible distinct options.


SOLUTION :- 

So we are basically asked for the number of partitions P(n,k) of an integer n into k indistinguishable parts.
The recurrence relation here is P(n, k) = P(n-k, k) + P(n-1, k-1).
Why? If the first (smallest) element is greater than 1, we can substract 1 from every element and get a valid partition of n-k into k parts, hence P(n-k, k).
If the first element is equal to 1, the rest form a partition of n-1 into k-1 parts, hence P(n-1, k-1).
